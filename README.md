# Recipe Recommender

"What shall we eat this evening?"

"What do you fancy?"

"Something like fajitas? But I had that yesterday for lunch..."

"If only we had some sort of Machine Learning based recommendation system that could help us out here..."

I'm sure we've all had this conversation at some point. So this repo is the answer to all our prayers!

## What is it?

This is a fun repo to give a very simple introduction to recommendation systems based on NLP and Embedding techniques. The API is set up so that any model could be used theoretically, however it is currently using a simple LDA model to find the embeddings.

Feel free to fork this repo and make it your own!
